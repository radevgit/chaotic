Chaotic Scattering with POV-Ray


This project was created somewhere around 2000 to reproduce the 
[Chaotic Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaotic_scattering) experiment with the help of POV-Ray raytracer.

The .pov file constructs a scene with 4 reflecting spheres and 4 light emitting planes arranged in pyramid, 
where each sphere touches each other. When ray cast from camera enters the space between the spheres it can scatter infinitely 
or exit in any direction. This creates fractal like structure.

The .ini file sets some parameters that provide tradeoff between performance and quality.
POV-Ray produces .png files that can be combined with the help of av.. to create animation.

You can try to change the antialias settings for better quality:
Antialias_Depth=9
Antialias_Threshold=0.001

Some old animation. When I have time will produce new one:
